int main()
{
	/// Part (A) Given a sorted numeric vector v and a target value x, find the first index i such that 
	/// v[i] <= x < v[i + 1]. Determine the return type.




	/// Part (B) Find the maximum error between two vectors v1 and v2 in a given index range [i; j]
	/// We wish to compute the difference in some(customisable) norm, specifically the absolute error, relative error and
	/// the index values where these errors occur.

	// Ideally, you should use the following C++ functionality if possible:
	//• Move semantics instead of copy constructors.
	//• Smart pointers(if applicable).
	//• Function objectsand lambda functions.
	//• Use as much of STL Algorithms as you can(investigate what’s in the library)
